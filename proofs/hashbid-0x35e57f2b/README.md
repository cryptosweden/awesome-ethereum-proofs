## Identification

Contract identified by ABI selector decode against openchain.xyz. 12 of 13 selectors resolve:

| Selector | Function |
|----------|----------|
| 0x0bf94512 | submitSolution(uint256) |
| 0x15df48bc | getBidderAt(uint256) |
| 0x200d2ed2 | status() |
| 0x3ff0d535 | getCompetitionEnd() |
| 0x409a967f | getHashAt(uint256) |
| 0x44b5f535 | (unresolved) |
| 0x5209ea57 | blockToHash() |
| 0x9391a16a | getBidAt(uint256) |
| 0x947a36fb | interval() |
| 0x9db6537d | bonusFund() |
| 0xc0336629 | setStatus() |
| 0xc2afd8c6 | getNumBids() |
| 0xe2543d1c | newBid(uint256) |

## Behaviour inferred from selectors and bytecode

A hash-prediction game with bid-and-solve mechanics:

1. Players call `newBid(uint)` to commit a guess at a future block's hash. Bids are appended to an enumerable array (`getNumBids`, `getBidAt`, `getBidderAt`, `getHashAt`).
2. `blockToHash()` returns the target block whose hash the solution must match.
3. Rounds advance through phases tracked by `status()` / `setStatus()`. `interval()` returns the round length; `getCompetitionEnd()` returns the cutoff block.
4. `submitSolution(uint)` is called once the target block is mined to claim the `bonusFund()` prize.

## Crack attempt result (NOT cracked)

Best partial reconstruction compiles to 816 bytes with v0.1.3-v0.1.7. Target is 2,152 bytes. cp=59 (only the boilerplate prelude and dispatch start match). Reconstruction is too sparse: `submitSolution`, `setStatus`, and several other function bodies are stubs. The unresolved selector `0x44b5f535` reads from a deterministic per-index storage slot but the function body and signature remain unknown.

What would crack it: full hand-decompilation of all 13 functions (multi-day effort), or recovery of the original source from the deployer's archives.

## Deployer activity

The deployer self-seeded the game in the first hour after deployment:
- Block 75,971: deployment (0.1 ETH funding)
- Block 75,979: 0.005 ETH top-up
- Block 75,997: `newBid(...)`
- Block 76,017: `setStatus()`
- Block 76,042: `setStatus()`
- Block 76,283: `newBid(...)`

The deployer's tx history (blocks 48679/48687) shows two earlier sends to Kraken's hot wallet at `0x2910543af39aba0cd0` with deposit tag `ENNX1N6W0`.
